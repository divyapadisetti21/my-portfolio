This is my personal portfolio website built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
It showcases my details, skills, projects, and work experience.  
It includes direct links to my projects, a section highlighting my technical skills, and an overview of my professional journey.  
Users can also download my resume directly from the website and contact me through the built-in contact form.  <br><br>
